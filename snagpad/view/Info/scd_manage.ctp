      <p>The 21st Century Strategic Job Search Management Course was designed to systematically guide learners through the necessary steps to successfully make the transition to the labor market. More specifically, the 21st Century Strategic Job Search Management Course involves six key areas:</p>
      <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt1.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(1) Developing a job search path -</strong> developing a strategic job search plan that is aligned to the learner's career path. This will enable the learner to think strategically about the jobs they take and how it will make them more competitive in the labor market.</p>
      <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt2.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(2) Dealing with the job search forces -</strong> these forces impact a job seekers ability to remain motivated throughout the job search process and if they are not addressed can derail the time it take to find a job.</p>
      <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt3.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(3) Identifying job-related opportunities -</strong> helps the learner accomplish their goals through the job search process (I.e., job leads, support, contacts) with the support of their network. Additionally, it helps to break down the 'job' goal into smaller pieces, making it more manageable.</p>
      <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt4.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(4) Collecting job search numbers -</strong> helps the job seeker to gauge how they are doing what requires improvement throughout their job search. Additionally, these numbers help to forecast required job-related activity required to successfully make the transition to the labor market.</p>
      <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt5.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(5) Understanding the hiring cycle -</strong> involves knowing when an employer decides to hire someone for a position until that individual starts working. If the job seeker is not entering the hiring cycle at the right time the chances for success diminishes. Knowledge of this will help to control the job search forces.</p>
       <p><?php echo $this->Html->image('courseManageLt6.jpg',array('escape'=>false));?><strong>(6) Managing the job search process -</strong> understanding that there are stages to getting a job that occur sequentially throughout the process. If the job seeker is not moving stage to stage within the typical hiring cycle, the likelihood get the job is reduced.</p>
